Based on the information available, **GridRoad** is a traffic optimization simulation game where players build roads, place road signs, and adjust traffic lights to create efficient traffic junctions. 

To replicate this game in C++ using SFML, you'll need to implement features such as road construction, traffic signal management, vehicle movement, and traffic flow optimization.

Here's an in-depth game logic documentation presented in a `README.md` format to guide you through the development process:

## Game Overview

**GridRoad** is a traffic optimization simulation game where players design and manage road networks to ensure efficient traffic flow. The primary objectives include:

- Constructing roads to connect various points.
- Placing road signs to control vehicle behavior.
- Adjusting traffic lights to manage intersections.
- Optimizing traffic flow to prevent congestion.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Road Construction

- **Grid-Based Layout**: The game world is divided into a grid where players can place road tiles.
- **Road Placement**: Players can select and place different types of road tiles (e.g., straight, curved, intersections) on the grid.

### Traffic Signals

- **Traffic Lights**: Players can place and configure traffic lights at intersections to control vehicle movement.
- **Road Signs**: Signs such as stop signs, yield signs, and speed limits can be placed to influence driver behavior.

### Vehicles

- **Spawning**: Vehicles appear at designated entry points and have destinations they aim to reach.
- **Movement**: Vehicles follow the road network, obeying traffic signals and signs.
- **Pathfinding**: Implement a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A*) to allow vehicles to navigate the road network efficiently.

### Scoring and Objectives

- **Efficiency Metrics**: Players are scored based on traffic flow efficiency, average travel time, and congestion levels.
- **Challenges**: Implement scenarios with specific objectives, such as managing rush hour traffic or handling road closures.

## Development Plan

1. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Install C++ development tools and SFML library.

2. **Design Game Architecture**
   - Define classes and their interactions.
   - Plan the game loop and state management.

3. **Implement Core Features**
   - Grid and road placement system.
   - Vehicle spawning and movement.
   - Traffic signal management.

4. **Develop User Interface**
   - Create menus, HUD, and in-game controls.

5. **Test and Debug**
   - Conduct thorough testing to identify and fix issues.

6. **Polish and Optimize**
   - Enhance graphics, optimize performance, and refine gameplay mechanics.

## Class Descriptions

### `Game`

Manages the overall game state, including initialization, the main game loop, and rendering.

- **Methods**:
  - `init()`: Initialize game components.
  - `run()`: Main game loop.
  - `processEvents()`: Handle user input.
  - `update()`: Update game state.
  - `render()`: Draw game elements.

### `Grid`

Represents the game grid and manages road placement.

- **Attributes**:
  - `tiles`: 2D array representing the grid.
- **Methods**:
  - `placeRoad(position, type)`: Place a road tile.
  - `removeRoad(position)`: Remove a road tile.
  - `draw()`: Render the grid.

### `Vehicle`

Represents vehicles in the game.

- **Attributes**:
  - `position`: Current position on the grid.
  - `destination`: Target position.
  - `speed`: Movement speed.
- **Methods**:
  - `update()`: Move towards the destination.
  - `draw()`: Render the vehicle.

### `TrafficSignal`

Manages traffic lights and road signs.

- **Attributes**:
  - `position`: Location on the grid.
  - `state`: Current signal state (e.g., red, green).
- **Methods**:
  - `toggle()`: Change signal state.
  - `draw()`: Render the signal.

### `UI`

Handles the user interface, including menus and HUD.

- **Methods**:
  - `displayMenu()`: Show the main menu.
  - `displayHUD()`: Show in-game HUD.
  - `handleInput()`: Process UI-related input.

## Game Loop

The game loop follows a standard structure:

1. **Process Events**: Handle user input and system events.
2. **Update**: Update game logic, including vehicle movement and traffic signal changes.
3. **Render**: Draw the current game state to the screen.

```cpp
while (window.isOpen()) {
    processEvents();
    update();
    render();
}
```

## User Interface

- **Main Menu**: Options to start the game, view instructions, and exit.
- **In-Game HUD**: Displays current score, time, and controls for placing roads and signals.
- **Pause Menu**: Allows pausing the game, adjusting settings, and returning to the main menu.

## Building and Running the Game

1. **Install Dependencies**
   - Ensure SFML is installed on your system.

2. **Build the Project**
   - Use CMake to configure the build system.
   - Compile the code using a C++ compiler.

3. **Run the Game**
   - Execute the compiled binary to start the game.
